Welcome to terraform

it is one of the famous Infrastracture tool

for aws --> cloudformation
for azure --> Azure resource manager

above clouds are not that mush comfortable

The third party tools is
Hashicorp terraform

* Infrastarture deployment made easy
* supports all cloud providers


====for infrastrcture management tools is terraform

configuration management tool is

ansible

Diff b/w infra and configuration mangement
once infrastracture deployment is done we can use configure management for more effictive work

Terraform Advantages && Disadvantages:
advantages:

importing of manual resources

Dis Advantages:
