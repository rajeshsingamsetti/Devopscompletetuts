Welcome to terraform

it is one of the famous Infrastracture tool

for aws --> cloudformation
for azure --> Azure resource manager

above clouds are not that mush comfortable

The third party tools is
Hashicorp terraform

* Infrastarture deployment made easy
* supports all cloud providers


====for infrastrcture management tools is terraform

configuration management tool is

chef
puppet
ansible

Diff b/w infra and configuration mangement
once infrastracture deployment is done we can use configure management for more effictive work

Terraform Advantages && Disadvantages:
advantages:
when compare to json teeraform code is simple
can be used with multiple cloud vendors
it's not that mush platform dependent the code will change depends upon platform
config can be split into multiple files
we can run perform dry-run easily for debugging purpose
importing of manual resources

Dis Advantages:
It's third party tool.new services might not be available
bugs in latest version (11.) is stable version
lack of support (paid for support)

** cloudformation and terraform both are same one is third party another is aws

How to use terraform on aws

let's start

install microsoft visual studio code in mac or windows
install terraform plugin on visual studio code

* install terraform on mac
download zip file from terraform official site

after follow the below official document
https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli

to check terraform installed or not in your system u simply enter the below command

terraform version

================now we need to configure aws=====================
login into aws account 
Go to iam
add user
username ==> give programatic access ==> next ==> click on attach existing policy + check on administartion access ==> next ==> click on create user ==> 

install configure aws cli
to configure
aws configure

    state              Advanced state management
===================
terrraform our first code
vscode open a folder
create a file as the main.tf

provider "aws" {
    region = "ap-south-1"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "mypc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

open terminal in vscode & type
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply + yes

Now u can see that your vpc is created in aws (but we did n't give our aws credentails means prviously we did aws configure
after apply we will see like this
=======
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_vpc.mypc: Creating...
aws_vpc.mypc: Creation complete after 5s [id=vpc-04b9719fa4475b4bd]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
===========
now copy ur vpc id go to ur aws and check your vpc is created or not

=========destroy====
terraform destroy + yes

================== vpc setup ==================

terraform state
Terraform must store state about your managed infrastructure and configuration. This state is used by Terraform to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures.

This state is stored by default in a local file named "terraform.tfstate", but it can also be stored remotely, which works better in a team environment.
"it will monitor the all your actions on terraform"

========Pre Variables======
for variables refer below url
https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-modules
https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/variables?in=terraform/configuration-language&utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS

https://github.com/addamstj/Terraform-012/blob/master/variables/main.tf

** reference all variables ex: string,number,array(list),boolen,maps(access by using keys)

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
}


variable "vpcname" {
  type    = string
  default = "myvpc"
}

variable "sshport" {
  type    = number
  default = 22
}

variable "enabled" {
  default = true
}

variable "mylist" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["Value1", "Value2"]
}

variable "mymap" {
  type = map
  default = {
    Key1 = "Value1"
    Key2 = "Value2"
  }
}

variable "inputname" {
  type        = string
  description = "Set the name of the VPC"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "myvpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"

  tags = {
    Name = var.inputname
  }
}

output "vpcid" {
  value = aws_vpc.myvpc.id
}

variable "mytuple" {
  type    = tuple([string, number, string])
  default = ["cat", 1, "dog"]
}

variable "myobject" {
  type = object({ name = string, port = list(number) })
  default = {
    name = "TJ"
    port = [22, 25, 80]
  }
}



inputname will take the vpc values from console

output we will get the all details of created vpc by using terraform
